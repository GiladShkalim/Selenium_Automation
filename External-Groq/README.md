# Groq Chat API Integration

Python script for enhancing discount data objects using Groq's AI API, with JSON-formatted responses.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Using the Enhancement Script (Recommended)

1. **Make the script executable and run it**
   ```bash
   chmod +x enhance_data.sh
   ./enhance_data.sh
   ```
   
   The script will:
   - Set up the Python environment automatically
   - Install required dependencies
   - Verify your API key
   - Run the enhancement process
   - Show progress indicators and detailed logs

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Setup Environment**
   ```bash
   # Deactivate the current virtual environment:
   deactivate

   # Remove the existing virtual environment:
   rm -rf venv

   # Ensure you have the necessary tools installed:
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3-venv python3-pip

   # Create a new virtual environment using the full path to python3:
   /usr/bin/python3 -m venv venv

   # Activate the new virtual environment:
   source venv/bin/activate

   # Upgrade pip within the virtual environment:
   pip install --upgrade pip

   # Now try installing the requirements again:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Add API Key**

   Address to your Groq's Admin user to receive API key.

   Create `.env` file:

   ```bash
   GROQ_API_KEY=<your_api_key_here>
   ```

3. **Run**
   ```bash
   python groq_chat.py
   ```

   The script will:
   - Read discount objects from `hot_discounts.json`
   - Process each object through Groq's API
   - Save enhanced objects to `enhanced_discounts.json`
   - Display a summary of results
